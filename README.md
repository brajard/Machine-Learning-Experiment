QGS-MAOOAM Machine Learning Experiment

In order for the test to run smoothly, a few steps are required

Copy the QGS folder to the dapper/mod folder

The Example folder is a related program for hybrid model building.Specifically include:

## 2_QGS_compute_trainingset.py

line 1 - 97ï¼š configure MAOOAM-HMM

line 99 - 104: Set the length range of input data

line 106-108: obtain the analysis values at time K and time K +1

line 113-114: obtain the model results at k+1 , and calculate the model error delta 

line 115-124: Standardize data and save relevant data
